towards the engines, campaigns or keywords
driving the strongest conversion rates
• Comparing user behavior patterns across
traffic sources to inform creative and
messaging strategy
• Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted
spend or scale high-converting traffic

/*1 We've been live for almost a month now and we’re
starting to generate sales. Can you help me understand
where the bulk of our website sessions are coming
from, through yesterday?
I’d like to see a breakdown by UTM source, campaign
and referring domain if possible. Thanks! */


/*2 Sounds like gsearch nonbrand is our major traffic source, but
we need to understand if those sessions are driving sales.
Could you please calculate the conversion rate (CVR) from
session to order? Based on what we're paying for clicks,
we’ll need a CVR of at least 4% to make the numbers work.
If we're much lower, we’ll need to reduce bids. If we’re
higher, we can increase bids to drive more volume.*/

/*3 Based on your conversion rate analysis, we bid down
gsearch nonbrand on 2012-04-15.
Can you pull gsearch nonbrand trended session volume, by
week, to see if the bid changes have caused volume to drop
at all? */

/*4 I was trying to use our site on my mobile device the other
day, and the experience was not great.
Could you pull conversion rates from session to order, by
device type?
If desktop performance is better than on mobile we may be
able to bid up for desktop specifically to get more volume?*/

/*5 After your device-level analysis of conversion rates, we
realized desktop was doing well, so we bid our gsearch
nonbrand desktop campaigns up on 2012-05-19.
Could you pull weekly trends for both desktop and mobile
so we can see the impact on volume?
You can use 2012-04-15 until the bid change as a baseline*/
